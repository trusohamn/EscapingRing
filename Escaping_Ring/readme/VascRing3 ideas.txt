deletion of chosen rings:
+if the ring is in the middle of the branch - delete the branch and create two new ones
-to solve - new naming of new branches

deletion of chosen branches:
+recalculate the workingVolume to restore the intensities in the place of deleted branch

joining of chosen rings:
-enable to choose the width value

gui
+make default parameter choices for empty, dull, binary vessels
+filter branches by length
+enable restart of contrast value
+show chosen rings 
+show chosen branches 
+keep the working and row volumes
-refresh button to refresh the view
+view in rgb stack
+selecting seed from rgb stack 
-clean button for branches and rings lists
-display image properties and proposed ring width


processing
+enable to stop processing unfinished branches
-enable make isotropic in xyz

output
+skeleton
-identification of branching points

to repair
+selecting rings and branches doesnt work well after implementing refreshing of one window
